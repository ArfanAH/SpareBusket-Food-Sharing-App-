A Food-Sharing application that enables donors to create detailed listings of available food, including information on location, quantity, and preferences. These listings can only be removed before a receiver makes a request. Receivers have the ability to browse listings, request food, and cancel their requests. The system includes a rating feature for users to report any problems during the food-sharing process. The admin panel oversees reports, issuing warnings or bans as necessary. Additionally, users can engage in real-time messaging for effective communication.
